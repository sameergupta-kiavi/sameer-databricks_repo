      necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample,
      then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set
      (e.g. geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness
      was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please
      describe why not (e.g. to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances

collection:
  readme: As with the previous section, dataset creators should read through these
    questions prior to any data collection to flag potential issues and then provide
    answers once collection is complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section,
    the answers to questions here may provide information that allow others to reconstruct
    the dataset without access to it.
  acquisition:
    prompt: How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data
      directly observable (e.g. raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g.
      survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g. part-of-speech
      tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects
      or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified?
      If so, please describe how.
    response: ''
  mechanisms:
    prompt: What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g. hardware
      apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?
      How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?
    response: ''
  sampling:
    prompt: If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy
      (e.g. deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?
    response: ''
  collectors:
    prompt: Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g. students, crowdworkers,
      contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g. how much were crowdworkers
      paid)?
    response: ''
  timeframe:
    prompt: Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match
      the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g. recent
      crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which
      the data associated with the instances was created. Finally, list when the dataset
      was first published.
    response: ''
  ethical-review:
    prompt: Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g. by an institutional
      review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes,
      including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting
      documentation.

preprocessing:
  readme: Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any pre-processing,
    cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers once these tasks are complete.
    The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers with the
    information they need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in
    ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example, text that has been
    converted into a “bag-of-words” is not suitable for tasks involving word order.
  processing:
    performed:
      prompt: Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g. discretization
        or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction,
        removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide
        a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this
        section.
      response: ''
    raw:
      prompt: Was the 'raw' data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled
        data (e.g. to support unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a
        link or other access point to the 'raw' data.
      response: ''
    software:
      prompt: Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?
        If so, please provide a link or other access point.

    response: ''
  impacted:
    prompt: Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was
      collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For
      example, is there anything that a future user might need to know to avoid uses
      that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g. stereotyping,
      quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g. financial harms,
      legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future
      user could do to mitigate these undesirable harms?
